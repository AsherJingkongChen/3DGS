## Why 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3DGS is a brand-new approach of 3D scene representation, and it is super fast on rendering.

## Overview of 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussians are projective transformations of static points. It's a sort of explicit representation of volumetric data.

First, You train a 3D Gaussian model from Structure from Motion (SfM) inputs, and then you can render the trained model by giving it camera poses.
