## Why 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3DGS is a brand-new approach of 3D scene representation, and it is super fast on rendering.

## Overview of 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussians are a set of ellipsoids with different color and opacity. Unlike neural networks in NeRF, the model is a explicit representation of the scene.

Once you have trained models, you can render images from certain viewpoints by anisotropic volumetric "splatting" of 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane.
