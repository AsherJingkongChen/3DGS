## Why 3D Gaussian Splatting?

3DGS is a brand-new approach of 3D scene representation, and it is super fast on rendering.

## Overview of 3D Gaussian Splatting

3DGS utilizes a differentiable rasterizer to facilitate real-time projection into the image space.

The models are a set of ellipsoid with color and opacity.

Once you have trained models, you can view rendered images by providing camera poses.
