# [âŽ—](./README.md) Procedure - Original Reference

## What components does it consist of?

Let's see [the description](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/?tab=readme-ov-file#overview) excerpted from the original manual:

> The codebase has 4 main components:
>
> - A PyTorch-based optimizer to produce a 3D Gaussian model from SfM inputs.
>
> - A network viewer that allows to connect to and visualize the optimization process.
>
> - An OpenGL-based real-time viewer to render trained models in real-time.
>
> - A script to help you turn your own images into optimization-ready SfM data sets.

Let's explain each of them in detail.

## Preprocessing

> A script to help you turn your own images into optimization-ready SfM data sets.

Let's check out their repository. They've [told](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/?tab=readme-ov-file#processing-your-own-scenes) us to use [`COLMAP`](https://colmap.github.io/) and [`./convert.py`](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/blob/main/convert.py) to **process your own scenes**.

The repository structure looks like this now:

```plaintext
./
|- convert.py
```

## Loading

After preprocessing and before training, we need to load the data and initialize the model.

Where does loading process happen? Let's check out their modules.

This is the dependency graph of loader modules, where we can see that `colmap_loader` is the base loader:

### Call Tree in Python modules

1. All items from `diff_gaussian_rasterization`
```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph diff_gaussian_rasterization
    GaussianRasterizer
    GaussianRasterizationSettings
  end
  subgraph gaussian_renderer
    render_function[render]
  end
  subgraph render
    render_set
    render_sets
    render_main[__main__]
  end
  subgraph train
    training
    train_main[__main__]
  end

  render_function --> GaussianRasterizer
  render_function --> GaussianRasterizationSettings
  render_set --> render_function
  render_sets --> render_set
  render_main --> render_sets
  training --> render_function
  train_main --> training
```

2. All items from `simple_knn`
```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph simple_knn
    distCUDA2
  end
  subgraph gaussian_model
    gm_cfd[GaussianModel.create_from_pcd]
  end
  subgraph scene.__init__
    scene[Scene.__init__]
  end
  subgraph train
    training
    train_main[__main__]
  end

  gm_cfd --> distCUDA2
  scene --> gm_cfd
  training --> scene
  train_main --> training
```

### Call Tree in CUDA C++ modules

1. All items from `diff_gaussian_rasterization`

2. All items from `simple_knn`
```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph simple_knn
    knn[SimpleKNN::knn]
    boxMeanDist
    boxMinMax
    CustomMin
    CustomMax
    coord2Morton
    distBoxPoint
    prepMorton
    updateKBest
  end
  subgraph spatial
    distCUDA2
  end

  boxMeanDist --> distBoxPoint
  boxMeanDist --> updateKBest

  coord2Morton --> prepMorton

  distCUDA2 --> knn

  knn --> boxMeanDist
  knn --> boxMinMax
  knn --> CustomMin
